/**
The apply function in Kotlin is a scope function that is used for modifying an object's properties within a lambda block
and returning the same object.

It is useful when you want to initialize or update an object in a clean and readable way.

/**
apply Example - Configuring Objects
apply is useful when setting multiple properties in one go.
ðŸ‘‰ Why use apply here?

It makes initialization look cleaner.
Instead of setting each property separately, everything is done inside apply
